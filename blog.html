        <h2>Our Certificate & Online Programs For 2021</h2>
        
        <p>Centurion University is duly recognized as a pioneer is ‘Skill Integrated Higher Education”. Its unique model lays specific emphasis on creating sustainable livelihoods on a national scale in challenging geographies through education that results in employability and sparks entrepreneurship. This model has been recognized by multiple Governments (Central and State), International Organizations such as UNESCO and the World Bank as well as Policy Think-tanks such as the Niti Ayog. Recently, Centurion University’s School of Vocational Education and Training has been recognized as a Center of Excellence by Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, Government of India. It is the only University in India to be recognized as such.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We have continually strived to be a best in class human resource development hub that builds employable, enterprising and society centric youth through industry relevant education, skill development, new ventures, production, and technology development.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The founders, faculty and staff are fully committed to its credo: Shaping Lives. Empowering Communities.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This credo is underpinned by a value system of Inclusivity, Integrity, Equity, Respect and Sustainability in everything we do.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Since its inception in 2005 and subsequent recognition as a University in 2010, Centurion has created a unique environment that ensures a tailored learning and employability path for youth in some of the poorest and underserved geographies in Odisha and Andhra Pradesh.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Centurion has embraced the Agenda for Sustainable Development and the associated Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) since being formally announced in 2015. SDGs have been both formally and informally used as a guiding framework and are now firmly embedded in the Centurion DNA. Whilst having an indirect impact and contribution on almost all 17 SDGs, Centurion has specifically focused on 7 SDGs and embedded it in everything from its strategy, governance, institutional management and outcomes.</p>
